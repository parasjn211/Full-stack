React notes : 
There  are two types of forms:

1) Controlled form: here useStae is used 
2) Uncontrolled form: here useRef is used


Assignment:


create a form containing
name 
phone
email
gender
known languages
submit
along with it show the output in table format like 
your count is : 

Difference between useState and useRef
1)When we call useStae it will return array, which contain variable name and function name
1)When we call useRef we get the object which contain current property to store the value

2)When we change the value of variable present in useState, component is rerender
2)When we change the value of useRef object it will not rerender component

3)useStae contain immutable data
3)useRef contain mutable data


Hookes

*) useMemo: useMemo hooke is used to buffer result of long calculation so that on every reload of component these long calculation is not executed. While calling usememo function we have to pass two parameters 
1. arrow function which contain code for long calculations
2. array of variables to indicate only called usememo when these variable changes 

it will return the result of long calculation which we can use in our application to display data

*) use Effect: Generally components are pure function, pure function means which perform only one task, but some times we want to perform the sideeffect operations such as getting data from servers or connecting to external server

if we write such a code in the component it will execute on every rerender of component. if we want to get data only one time or depending on condition, then we have to use useEffect hooke 

Syntax: useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)


condition 
1) No dependency pass
	useEffect(()=>{
	//Runs on every render
}

2) An empty array
	useEffect(()=>{
	//Runs on the first render
},[])

3) Pass properties on 
	useEffect(()=>{
	//Runs on the first render
	// aned anyt tine any dependency value changes 
},[prop,, state]);
